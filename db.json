However, my Fedora ami is only running PHP 5.03\\. So, how do I use JSON without recompiling my php installation, or downloading 5 billion files? Michal Migurski created a php-json library that is now a part of PEAR, but he still has a copy of his original encoder/decoder at [http://mike.teczno.com/JSON/JSON.phps](http://mike.teczno.com/JSON/JSON.phps). It's licenced BSD-style so have at it.\n\nNext, I wanted to sent http requests by POST, including file uploads, again without downloading 5 billion files or messing with my ami. My solution was to actually learn the 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' format and 'multipart/form-data' format and send the HTTP request across a socket.\n\nA resource that helped me with the 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' format is on [www.wellho.net](http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=h110/getpost.php). For the 'multipart/form-data' format [http://chxo.com/be2/20050724_93bf.html](http://chxo.com/be2/20050724_93bf.html) was very helpful.

However, my Fedora ami is only running PHP 5.03\\. So, how do I use JSON without recompiling my php installation, or downloading 5 billion files? Michal Migurski created a php-json library that is now a part of PEAR, but he still has a copy of his original encoder/decoder at [http://mike.teczno.com/JSON/JSON.phps](http://mike.teczno.com/JSON/JSON.phps). It's licenced BSD-style so have at it.\n\nNext, I wanted to sent http requests by POST, including file uploads, again without downloading 5 billion files or messing with my ami. My solution was to actually learn the 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' format and 'multipart/form-data' format and send the HTTP request across a socket.\n\nA resource that helped me with the 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' format is on [www.wellho.net](http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=h110/getpost.php). For the 'multipart/form-data' format [http://chxo.com/be2/20050724_93bf.html](http://chxo.com/be2/20050724_93bf.html) was very helpful.

[JavaScript is not Java](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200909/java_is_not_javascript/). The name came from trying to ride on Java's hype. [JavaScript is to Java as Hamster is to Ham](http://adactio.com/journal/1595). Understand? Moving on...\n\nHopefully, most programmers now know that JavaScript is object-oriented. I'm afraid though that most believe object-oriented is synonymous with classical inheritance, which you will not find in JavaScript. JavaScript instead uses prototypal inheritance.\n\nClassical Inheritance in Java:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\nclass Fruit {\n  private String name;\n  public Fruit(String n) { name = n; }\n  public toString() { return name; }\n}\n\nclass Banana extends Fruit {\n  public Banana() { super(\"banana\"); }\n}\n\n// (new Banana()) instanceof Banana and Fruit\n```\n\nWith classical inheritance, as in Java, you define classes. Classes are templates or blueprints for what an object of that type will be like. Objects, which are instances of a class, get all the methods and fields associated with the class and the classes it inherits.\n\nWhen you call a method, first the runtime looks in the class, then if it can't find the definition, it traverses up the class hierarchy until it finds the method definition.\n\nPrototypal Inheritance in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Fruit(name) { this.name = name; }\nFruit.prototype = { name:null, toString:function() { return this.name; } };\n\nfunction Banana() { Fruit.call(this, 'banana'); }\nBanana.prototype = new Fruit(null);\n\n// (new Banana()) instanceOf Banana and Fruit \n```\n\nAs you can see in JavaScript, with prototypal inheritance, there are no classes. The 'class' keyword is not used. Objects inherit from other objects. (The Banana prototype is an 'instance' of Fruit.) Constructors are just normal functions that you may call with the 'new' keyword.\n\nWhen you access any property, the runtime checks the object, then if it cannot find the property, it traverses up the prototype object hierarchy until it finds the property. If it doesn't find the property, it returns undefined.\n\nThe new keyword is a little deceptive, because it looks the same as Java. This is closer to what really happens:\n\n```javascript\n// var banana = new Banana(a, b);\nvar banana = {}; // new Object()\n// assume __proto__ is a hidden field, used internally for the prototype hierarchy\nbanana.__proto__ = Banana.prototype;\nvar temp = Banana.call(banana, a, b); // call the Banana function with 'this' set to the banana object\nbanana = (temp && typeof temp === 'object') ? temp : banana;\n\n// banana.name;\nvar temp = banana;\nwhile (!temp.hasOwnProperty('name') && temp.__proto__) { temp = temp.__proto__; }\nreturn temp.hasOwnProperty('name') ? temp.name : undefined;\n```\n\nPlease note that this code is an oversimplification, but hopefully helps you to understand what is happening behind the scenes. One of the interesting things you may have noticed from the above code is that when you call 'new Banana()', you might not get back what you expect. See one way you can implement the Factory pattern in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Fruit(name, color) {\n  if (typeof Fruit[name] === 'function')) return new Fruit[name]();\n  this.name = name;\n  this.color = color;\n  return this;\n}\nFruit.prototype = { name:null, color:null };\n\nFruit.Banana = function Banana() { return this; };\nFruit.Banana.prototype = new Fruit('Banana', 'yellow');\n\nFruit.Apple = function Apple() { return this; };\nFruit.Apple.prototype = new Fruit('Apple', 'red');\n\nvar banana = new Fruit('Banana'); // instanceOf Fruit and Banana\nvar apple = new Fruit('Apple'); // instanceOf Fruit and Apple\nvar kiwi = new Fruit('Kiwi'); // instanceOf Fruit\n```\n\nAs most of JavaScript's powerful dynamic features, it could easily be used for evil as well as for good.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Droid() { return new IPhone(); }\nvar phone = new Droid(); // this is not the droid you're looking for\n```\n\n[wtfjs.com](http://wtfjs.com/) is full of examples where JavaScript does weird things, but almost invariably because you tried to do something weird in the code. With a small amount of restraint on the developer's part, JavaScript can be powerful and need not be a mystery.\n","source":"_posts/i-thought-i-new-you-javascript.md","raw":"title: I thought I new you(JavaScript);\ntags:\n  - class\n  - inheritance\n  - JavaScript\n  - learn\n  - oop\n  - script\n  - understand\nid: 73\ncategories:\n  - JavaScript\ndate: 2011-04-04 16:08:01\n---\n\nThis is the first of hopefully many posts aiming to demystify javascript.\n\nThe first thing to get over is the name.

In 2006 I had recently returned from Brazil and I decided to get going on that books again.  After reading the 200+ pages I had written prior, I was completely dissatisfied and started over.  Due to getting married, having kids, and trying to get an education, I now have a whole 10 pages worth in my book, <u>The Brothers of Linester</u>.\n\nWell, that seems to  state my life in a nutshell.  Life is good.","slug":"hello-world","published":1,"updated":"2015-05-27T18:44:09.000Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ciacr8s6l006tt19w6i4ubjv8"},{"title":"Growing Software","id":"24","date":"2008-04-11T20:54:37.000Z","_content":"\nAgile methods have proven time and again to produce better software quicker.

What I have found most fun so far is the synergy I get between certain components.\n\n**Templates**\n\nFirst off, I admit I'm a reinvent-the-wheel kind of engineer. I readily find some minor fault in existing solutions and decide I have to write my own. [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) is really great, especially for someone coming from a PHP background, who doesn't think logic-less templates are better than sliced bread. However, I really needed templates that can run asynchronously, doing file or network io for includes and other such magic.\n\nSo, I made [Stencil](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/stencil/). I was able to make templates that compile without mucking up the line numbers, so debugging is very straight-forward. No exception rethrowing necessary. The very-important async use case was satisfied without making all templates forced to use the async pattern.\n\n[source language=\"javascript\"]\nsync_result = sync_tpl(data); // works if no async code in template\nasync_tpl(data, function(err, async_result) { }); // always works\n[/source]\n\nWhere the whole becomes more than the sum of parts: A small snippet makes it so I can directly `require` my templates, and get back the function instead of the string:\n\n[source language=\"javascript\"]\nrequire.extensions['.html'] = function(module, filename) {\n\tvar fs = require('fs'), stencil = require('stencil-js'),\n\t\topts = { id:filename, src:fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8') };\n\tmodule._compile(\n\t\t'module.exports=' + stencil.compile(opts, true) + ';',\n\t\tfilename\n\t);\n};\n[/source]\n\nNow the rest of my code that uses templates doesn't have to care that I use Stencil. You just `tpl = require('path/to/template.html')`. This is possible because Node.js has an extensible require, and Stencil allows you to compile to a JavaScript string instead of just to a function. If I were to go back and change the templating system to EJS, Jade, or Mustache, I would only need to update this one little snippet.\n\n**Client CommonJS**\n\nI liked Node.js's module system, and I didn't want to have to [replace it](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) or use a separate system on the front end. Don't get me started on mess of [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd). So, I created my own [Modules library](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/modules/). You've [heard](http://thetalecrafter.com/2010/01/30/javascript-require-in-100-lines-of-code/ \"JavaScript require in 100 lines of code\") [about](http://thetalecrafter.com/2011/04/13/load-only-when-needed-or-preload-everything/ \"Load only when needed, or Preload everything?\") this [before](http://thetalecrafter.com/2011/09/22/commonjs-in-the-browser/ \"CommonJS in the Browser\").\n\nI got CommonJS modules to load (asynchronously) and run in the browser, so it was trivial to share code used on both ends. Again, line numbers weren't munged in the server-side translation, so debugging works just like you always expect it to.\n\nThe library runs as a middleware for [Express](http://expressjs.com/), enabling the reload functionality [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) lovers rave about, as well as standalone for concatenating and minifying bundles in the production build process. All with a client-side weight one-third that of [AlmondJS](https://github.com/jrburke/almond), although that or [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) would also work on the front-end, since Modules still uses AMD as its transport format.\n\nThe real magic though, is that the Modules library has an option for translating certain types of files, giving us the same `require` functionality for our templates that we had on the server, and because the translation happens server side (or at build time), the client code can keep a [Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) that disallows eval and unsafe inline code, as Stencil never has to be loaded in client code. (Lighter &amp; more secure. Woohoo!)\n\n[source language=\"javascript\"]\napp.use(require('modules').middleware({\n\ttranslate:{\n\t\thtml:function tpl(name, file, src) {\n\t\t\tvar opts = { id:name, src:src };\n\t\t\treturn 'module.exports=' + stencil.compile(opts, true) + ';';\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\troot: './components/', // file root path\n\tpath: '/module/', // url root path\n\t// ... other options\n}));\n[/source]\n\n**Backbone**\n\nOne magic thing that I got for free, is that Backbone and Underscore are already CommonJS compatible, so passing them through the same middleware just worked. [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), and countless other Node.js modules also just work.\n\n**Adding it all together**\n\nWhile I chose to write my own templating and module components, many other libraries include the little hooks that make these synergies possible.

The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2\\. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.\n\nNot only did Amazon's library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/), but as fate would have it, that library didn't work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.\n\nThe script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn't depend on anything that isn't built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven't implemented yet.\n\n```php\n&lt;?php\n/**\n * AWS_SimpleDB_Client v0.1 by Andy VanWagoner, distributed under the ISC licence.\n * Provides simple access to Amazon's SimpleDB from PHP 5.\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2009, Andy VanWagoner\n *\n * Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\n * purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\n * copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n *\n * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\n * WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

Most of the time, these features are either experimental or not finished with the standardization process when they are generally available. So, they are prefixed by the vendor. This is how the process was designed, so that is what vendors do.\n\n**Why do we prefix?**\n\nPrefixing is a kind of disclaimer for the feature. \"Hey this is likely going to change, so don't rely on it.\" This seems in theory like a good way to go about it. If I am a browser maker, and I think of a cool new feature, like say, a gradient defined in css instead of an image, I really won't know how good my design is until lots of people have used it and given feedback. Of course, if I am conscientious of the community and betterment of the web for everybody, I share my idea with other browser vendors and get their take on it too. Often we have competing ideas of how to implement it, so we want a way to distinguish between them. This competition is wonderful, and will lead us to a better solution. So, I make my background-image:-andy-linear-gradient(...), and my competitor makes their background:-steve-gradient(linear, color-stop(), ...). Some people can try it out and it will work through the standards process and eventually everyone will have a background:linear-gradient(...) feature.\n\nIn theory it works out great, but what about in practice?\n\n**Here's what actually happens, from a dev's perspective.**\n\nMy favorite browser, Shiny, implements a cool new feature: -shiny-gradient(). I play with it and think it's really cool, but to be safe, I don't actually use it in any production site. A year later, the other browser I support, Ice Monster has long since added their own -ice-gradient(). Two years later, pretty much every browser has their own prefixed version, even the Laggard browser.\n\nNice. It only took two years for the feature to be generally available, so I start to use it, even though my code looks like this:\n\n```css\nbackground-image: -shiny-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(hsl(0, 80%, 70%)), to(#BADA55));\nbackground-image: -shiny-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:    -ice-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:    -lag-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:     -my-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:         linear-gradient(top bottom, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\n```\n\nI don't mind too much, because I use SASS or some other css pre-processor that actually takes care of all the prefixes and nuances. But this still bothers me in two important ways.\n\n1.  My stylesheets are getting much heavier than they used to be, which is a concern because I want people to be able to view my site quickly even on mobile devices. Most of the syntax is exactly the same, but I still have to write it over and over again for each vendor.\n2.  I have to opt in for each browser I want to get the feature. If a new browser becomes popular, it won't get the gradients unless I go back and add yet another version.\nI complain, but I keep doing it anyway. Two years later (Now **four years** since it was first introduced), The standard is still a draft, and because I want to support not just the bleeding edge browser, even when the standard finalizes I must leave all of the vendor prefixes indefinitely.\n\n**The problem gets more real with mobile.**\n\nManagement asks for a ShinyPhone version of our application. They don't care about Robot, even though it uses -shiny prefixes. I am given enough time to make the ShinyPhone version, but no time to even test in Robot. Eventually though, I manage to get it working because I own a Robot phone.\n\nA few months later, Catchup Phone 7, Ice Monster Mobile, and Concert Mini are showing up on more phones. They have their prefixed version of all the great Shiny features I used, but because I didn't know about them, the mobile application looks awful, and would take me several weeks to fix for each new phone. Management is not willing to spend that kind of time, so **even though they have all the features my site is broken for them**. Who will our customers blame? It works on ShinyPhone, so it must be that Ice Monster Mobile just isn't as good. **Ice Monster and other browsers get blamed for my site not working well there**.\n\n**The Solution?**\n\nIt is clear that if other browsers want to make themselves look good, they have to do more than just implement the feature. **If they just use -shiny prefixes**, that would make my application work far better, and therefore make their browser look good. But that completely undermines what we've learned in the browser wars, and goes against the reason for prefixing in the first place!\n\n**We don't really have a good solution yet.**\n\nHowever, I have an idea I think worth talking about. **What if the feature hadn't been prefixed at all?** I would have been less nervous to put it into production, because CSS simply doesn't apply rules that aren't implemented, and though it will likely change syntax, I can add new versions, and the one that is implemented will work.
