When a new feature is available in a few browsers, I want to use it. Most of the time, these features are either experimental or not finished with the standardization process when they are generally available. So, they are prefixed by the vendor. This is how the process was designed, so that is what vendors do.\n\n**Why do we prefix?**\n\nPrefixing is a kind of disclaimer for the feature. \"Hey this is likely going to change, so don't rely on it.\" This seems in theory like a good way to go about it. If I am a browser maker, and I think of a cool new feature, like say, a gradient defined in css instead of an image, I really won't know how good my design is until lots of people have used it and given feedback. Of course, if I am conscientious of the community and betterment of the web for everybody, I share my idea with other browser vendors and get their take on it too. Often we have competing ideas of how to implement it, so we want a way to distinguish between them. This competition is wonderful, and will lead us to a better solution. So, I make my background-image:-andy-linear-gradient(...), and my competitor makes their background:-steve-gradient(linear, color-stop(), ...). Some people can try it out and it will work through the standards process and eventually everyone will have a background:linear-gradient(...) feature.\n\nIn theory it works out great, but what about in practice?\n\n**Here's what actually happens, from a dev's perspective.**\n\nMy favorite browser, Shiny, implements a cool new feature: -shiny-gradient(). I play with it and think it's really cool, but to be safe, I don't actually use it in any production site. A year later, the other browser I support, Ice Monster has long since added their own -ice-gradient(). Two years later, pretty much every browser has their own prefixed version, even the Laggard browser.\n\nNice. It only took two years for the feature to be generally available, so I start to use it, even though my code looks like this:\n\n```css\nbackground-image: -shiny-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(hsl(0, 80%, 70%)), to(#BADA55));\nbackground-image: -shiny-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:    -ice-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:    -lag-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:     -my-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:         linear-gradient(top bottom, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\n```\n\nI don't mind too much, because I use SASS or some other css pre-processor that actually takes care of all the prefixes and nuances. But this still bothers me in two important ways.\n\n1.  My stylesheets are getting much heavier than they used to be, which is a concern because I want people to be able to view my site quickly even on mobile devices. Most of the syntax is exactly the same, but I still have to write it over and over again for each vendor.\n2.  I have to opt in for each browser I want to get the feature. If a new browser becomes popular, it won't get the gradients unless I go back and add yet another version.\nI complain, but I keep doing it anyway. Two years later (Now **four years** since it was first introduced), The standard is still a draft, and because I want to support not just the bleeding edge browser, even when the standard finalizes I must leave all of the vendor prefixes indefinitely.\n\n**The problem gets more real with mobile.**\n\nManagement asks for a ShinyPhone version of our application. They don't care about Robot, even though it uses -shiny prefixes. I am given enough time to make the ShinyPhone version, but no time to even test in Robot. Eventually though, I manage to get it working because I own a Robot phone.\n\nA few months later, Catchup Phone 7, Ice Monster Mobile, and Concert Mini are showing up on more phones. They have their prefixed version of all the great Shiny features I used, but because I didn't know about them, the mobile application looks awful, and would take me several weeks to fix for each new phone. Management is not willing to spend that kind of time, so **even though they have all the features my site is broken for them**. Who will our customers blame? It works on ShinyPhone, so it must be that Ice Monster Mobile just isn't as good. **Ice Monster and other browsers get blamed for my site not working well there**.\n\n**The Solution?**\n\nIt is clear that if other browsers want to make themselves look good, they have to do more than just implement the feature. **If they just use -shiny prefixes**, that would make my application work far better, and therefore make their browser look good. But that completely undermines what we've learned in the browser wars, and goes against the reason for prefixing in the first place!\n\n**We don't really have a good solution yet.**\n\nHowever, I have an idea I think worth talking about. **What if the feature hadn't been prefixed at all?** I would have been less nervous to put it into production, because CSS simply doesn't apply rules that aren't implemented, and though it will likely change syntax, I can add new versions, and the one that is implemented will work. My stylesheet ends up more like this:\n\n```css\nbackground-image: gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(hsl(0, 80%, 70%)), to(#BADA55));\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(top bottom, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\n```\n\nMy application just works for every browser that supports the feature with little thought or effort from my part, and if the spec doesn't change, which it actually doesn't change very often, I am already done more than four years before it is standardized.\n\n**Benefits of prefixing:**\n\n1.  **Sense** of security for browser vendors, so they can change the implementation and make it better.\n2.  Web developers **should** be aware that the feature isn't really ready yet.\n3.  **Credit** goes to the vendor who pioneered the feature.\n**Benefits of NOT prefixing:**\n\n1.  **Less effort** and maintenance for web developers trying to make their application (and browsers) look good. They don't need to spend a lot of time researching which browsers support which features.\n2.  **Lighter weight** stylesheets for everyone, especially mobile browsers.\n3.  Browser vendors can focus on the **feature**s, not on evangelizing their prefix.\n4.  **No -webkit- prefixes being supported by Mozilla**. Dang, I said it after trying so hard not to.\nHonestly I do see the value in prefixing experimental and non-standardized features, but vendors have to break them often, and the standard needs to move faster if developers are realistically going to experiment with experimental features, and wait for the standard for production use.\n\nPlease feel free to disagree in the comments, check out the discussion going on in the [w3c](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0313.html), or [read up](http://paulirish.com/2012/vendor-prefixes-are-not-developer-friendly/) on [other](http://blog.vandenoostende.com/2012/on-vendor-prefixes/) [opinions](http://www.sitepoint.com/w3c-css-webkit-prefix-crisis/).

When a new feature is available in a few browsers, I want to use it. Most of the time, these features are either experimental or not finished with the standardization process when they are generally available. So, they are prefixed by the vendor. This is how the process was designed, so that is what vendors do.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do we prefix?</strong></p>\n<p>Prefixing is a kind of disclaimer for the feature. “Hey this is likely going to change, so don’t rely on it.” This seems in theory like a good way to go about it. If I am a browser maker, and I think of a cool new feature, like say, a gradient defined in css instead of an image, I really won’t know how good my design is until lots of people have used it and given feedback. Of course, if I am conscientious of the community and betterment of the web for everybody, I share my idea with other browser vendors and get their take on it too. Often we have competing ideas of how to implement it, so we want a way to distinguish between them. This competition is wonderful, and will lead us to a better solution. So, I make my background-image:-andy-linear-gradient(…), and my competitor makes their background:-steve-gradient(linear, color-stop(), …). Some people can try it out and it will work through the standards process and eventually everyone will have a background:linear-gradient(…) feature.</p>\n<p>In theory it works out great, but what about in practice?</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what actually happens, from a dev’s perspective.</strong></p>\n<p>My favorite browser, Shiny, implements a cool new feature: -shiny-gradient(). I play with it and think it’s really cool, but to be safe, I don’t actually use it in any production site. A year later, the other browser I support, Ice Monster has long since added their own -ice-gradient(). Two years later, pretty much every browser has their own prefixed version, even the Laggard browser.</p>\n<p>Nice. It only took two years for the feature to be generally available, so I start to use it, even though my code looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight css\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">background-image</span>: <span class=\"selector-tag\">-shiny-gradient</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">linear</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">left</span> <span class=\"selector-tag\">top</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">left</span> <span class=\"selector-tag\">bottom</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">from</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">hsl</span>(0, 80%, 70%)), <span class=\"selector-tag\">to</span>(<span class=\"selector-id\">#BADA55</span>));</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">background-image</span>: <span class=\"selector-tag\">-shiny-linear-gradient</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">top</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">hsl</span>(0, 80%, 70%), <span class=\"selector-id\">#BADA55</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">background-image</span>:    <span class=\"selector-tag\">-ice-linear-gradient</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">top</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">hsl</span>(0, 80%, 70%), <span class=\"selector-id\">#BADA55</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">background-image</span>:    <span class=\"selector-tag\">-lag-linear-gradient</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">top</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">hsl</span>(0, 80%, 70%), <span class=\"selector-id\">#BADA55</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">background-image</span>:     <span class=\"selector-tag\">-my-linear-gradient</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">top</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">hsl</span>(0, 80%, 70%), <span class=\"selector-id\">#BADA55</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"selector-tag\">background-image</span>:         <span class=\"selector-tag\">linear-gradient</span>(<span class=\"selector-tag\">top</span> <span class=\"selector-tag\">bottom</span>, <span class=\"selector-tag\">hsl</span>(0, 80%, 70%), <span class=\"selector-id\">#BADA55</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>I don’t mind too much, because I use SASS or some other css pre-processor that actually takes care of all the prefixes and nuances.

The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2\\. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.\n\nNot only did Amazon's library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/), but as fate would have it, that library didn't work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.\n\nThe script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn't depend on anything that isn't built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven't implemented yet.\n\n```php\n&lt;?php\n/**\n * AWS_SimpleDB_Client v0.1 by Andy VanWagoner, distributed under the ISC licence.\n * Provides simple access to Amazon's SimpleDB from PHP 5.\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2009, Andy VanWagoner\n *\n * Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\n * purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\n * copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n *\n * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\n * WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven’t implemented yet.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight php\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

Distributed Systems Design, I hit another stumbling block. The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.</p>\n<p>Not only did Amazon’s library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Code</a>, but as fate would have it, that library didn’t work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.</p>\n<p>The script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn’t depend on anything that isn’t built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven’t implemented yet.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight php\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

high school some friends and I made an a cappella group called Ambience.

Due to its dynamic nature, errors in JavaScript can show up much later in the dev process, sometimes making it all the way to production environments before they are first noticed. Many tools, like linters and type checkers, have been introduced to try to detect errors earlier. However, with Promises sometimes no error is ever thrown at all, your code just doesn't work as you expect it to.\n\nA small example to illustrate:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getResult() {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    someAsyncFunction(resolve) // this function may throw an error asynchronously\n  })\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, `reject` never gets called. You must explicitly handle the error condition, or you won't get so much as an error in the console. The error is thrown, but swallowed by the promise.\n\nSo why don't I just handle the error? The point is not that errors cannot be handled. They certainly can be. The problem is that it is easier to do the wrong thing with promises. By default errors are caught and ignored.\n\nFurthermore, async stack traces suck. This is a pain point for both promises and callbacks. Assuming an error occurs somewhere deep in asynchrony, the stack may only show you where the error was thrown, and have little or no context of where the function was called in the first place.\n\n**Both of these problems go away when using async function with await.**\n\nES7 (or ES 2016 if you prefer) proposes a new keywords `async` and `await`. Under the hood, the new mechanism uses promises, but by default does the right thing.\n\nThe prior example becomes:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getResult() {\n  return await someAsyncFunction()\n}\n```\n\nThis code assumes `someAsyncFunction` is also updated to the new syntax.\n\nSo what did we get?\n\n1.  If something goes wrong an error is thrown, and ends up in the console if not handled.\n2.  The stack trace is complete, so you can see what initiated the failed action.\n3.  A try/catch around your `getResult()` call works.\n\nWant to know more about how `async` and `await` work?

I even started a [repository on github](https://github.com/thetalecrafter/modules) for my implementation. As is apparent from [searching](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=commonjs+in+the+browser), the task is non-trivial, and there are lots of people trying to do the same thing, and every one of them has a different idea about how it should work.\n\n**But WHY would you want to use CommonJS (formerly known as ServerJS) modules in a client environment?**\n\nIdeally you can share modules between client and server, but that requires you to use a server environment like [node.js](nodejs.org), which might make management really nervous. Even without sharing the CommonJS module system helps us avoid some annoyances in JavaScript development.\n\n*   Each module has it's own scope. I don't have to manually wrap each file in a function to get a new variable scope. (Of course, to achieve this, the boilerplate is going to have to wrap each module's code in a function anyway.)\n*   Namespaces are only used in the require function, not everywhere in my code. Almost inevitably every web application I've worked in ends up using code like the following:\n```javascript\n    var whatIWanted = new FormerCompanyName.Common.CoolLibrary.ConstructorName( More.namespace.chains.than.you.can.follow );\n    // the rest of this file continues to use these ridiculously long namespaces\n```\n\nAlthough I'm sure many will disagree with me, I much prefer the CommonJS way:\n\n```javascript\n    var CoolModule = require('common/cool-library'),\n        thingINeed = require('more/namespace/chains/than/you/can/follow'),\n        whatIWanted = new CoolModule.ConstructorName(thingINeed);\n    // the rest of the file is void of long namespaces\n```\n\nAnd much more importantly, when I define a new module (or class as some insist on calling them):\n\n```javascript\n    FormerCompanyName.Common.CoolLibrary.ConstructorName = function() {/* ... */};\n    // versus\n    exports.ConstructorName = function() {/* ... */};\n    // or even\n    module.exports = function() {/* ... */} // this case isn't in the spec, but I really like it, so I made sure my library can handle it.\n```\n*   Because you can also use relative module identifiers (\"./sibling-module\", \"../uncle-module\"), when the company changes it's name, it can be as simple as renaming a folder to update all the top-level module ids.\n*   Additionally, modules can be included in the page in any order, and are only executed when first required, instead of all modules executing immediately upon inclusion, requiring the script order to be specific and fragile. If I add a new module using CommonJS, I can just append it to the end of the list, otherwise I have to make sure it is earlier in the page than whatever uses it, and after whatever it uses.\n**Okay, but how much work is it going to be?**\n\nLet's walk through first what I wanted my server-side code to look like, then what it has to do to make it work on the other side.\n\nAs most of my server-side experience thus far has been in php, that's the first language I've used in my implementation.\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Awesome Application</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"awesome-styles.css\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- blah blah blah -->\n    <?= Modules::script() /* include all necessary script tags */ ?>\n    <script>require('awesome').go()</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe Modules class will look for all js files in the folder you put it in, and any subfolders, and will id them by their path.\n\nYes, I am including every module, not actually checking dependencies. I refer you back to [my previous post](/2011/04/13/load-only-when-needed-or-preload-everything/) and say this is the simplest way, and if the caching headers are working, the experience won't suffer. You are welcome to use one of the [fantastic libraries](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=async+require+javascript) that loads modules on-demand, if you disagree.\n\nHopefully that is all the server-side API you need to worry about, but there is more if you need it.\n\n**So what is that library doing to my poor scripts to make the CommonJS module environment?**\n\nI will explain in detail what goes into it in another post, but if you are daring, you can check out the source on [github](https://github.com/thetalecrafter/modules).\n","source":"_posts/commonjs-in-the-browser.md","raw":"title: CommonJS in the Browser\ntags:\n  - CommonJS\n  - include\n  - JavaScript\n  - modules\n  - require\nid: 109\ncategories:\n  - JavaScript\ndate: 2011-09-22 14:33:25\n---\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about how to use [CommonJS modules](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1) in my web applications.

What I have found most fun so far is the synergy I get between certain components.\n\n**Templates**\n\nFirst off, I admit I'm a reinvent-the-wheel kind of engineer. I readily find some minor fault in existing solutions and decide I have to write my own. [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) is really great, especially for someone coming from a PHP background, who doesn't think logic-less templates are better than sliced bread. However, I really needed templates that can run asynchronously, doing file or network io for includes and other such magic.\n\nSo, I made [Stencil](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/stencil/). I was able to make templates that compile without mucking up the line numbers, so debugging is very straight-forward. No exception rethrowing necessary. The very-important async use case was satisfied without making all templates forced to use the async pattern.\n\n```javascript\nsync_result = sync_tpl(data); // works if no async code in template\nasync_tpl(data, function(err, async_result) { }); // always works\n```\n\nWhere the whole becomes more than the sum of parts: A small snippet makes it so I can directly `require` my templates, and get back the function instead of the string:\n\n```javascript\nrequire.extensions['.html'] = function(module, filename) {\n\tvar fs = require('fs'), stencil = require('stencil-js'),\n\t\topts = { id:filename, src:fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8') };\n\tmodule._compile(\n\t\t'module.exports=' + stencil.compile(opts, true) + ';',\n\t\tfilename\n\t);\n};\n```\n\nNow the rest of my code that uses templates doesn't have to care that I use Stencil. You just `tpl = require('path/to/template.html')`. This is possible because Node.js has an extensible require, and Stencil allows you to compile to a JavaScript string instead of just to a function. If I were to go back and change the templating system to EJS, Jade, or Mustache, I would only need to update this one little snippet.\n\n**Client CommonJS**\n\nI liked Node.js's module system, and I didn't want to have to [replace it](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) or use a separate system on the front end. Don't get me started on mess of [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd). So, I created my own [Modules library](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/modules/). You've [heard](http://thetalecrafter.com/2010/01/30/javascript-require-in-100-lines-of-code/ \"JavaScript require in 100 lines of code\") [about](http://thetalecrafter.com/2011/04/13/load-only-when-needed-or-preload-everything/ \"Load only when needed, or Preload everything?\") this [before](http://thetalecrafter.com/2011/09/22/commonjs-in-the-browser/ \"CommonJS in the Browser\").\n\nI got CommonJS modules to load (asynchronously) and run in the browser, so it was trivial to share code used on both ends. Again, line numbers weren't munged in the server-side translation, so debugging works just like you always expect it to.\n\nThe library runs as a middleware for [Express](http://expressjs.com/), enabling the reload functionality [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) lovers rave about, as well as standalone for concatenating and minifying bundles in the production build process. All with a client-side weight one-third that of [AlmondJS](https://github.com/jrburke/almond), although that or [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) would also work on the front-end, since Modules still uses AMD as its transport format.\n\nThe real magic though, is that the Modules library has an option for translating certain types of files, giving us the same `require` functionality for our templates that we had on the server, and because the translation happens server side (or at build time), the client code can keep a [Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) that disallows eval and unsafe inline code, as Stencil never has to be loaded in client code. (Lighter & more secure. Woohoo!)\n\n```javascript\napp.use(require('modules').middleware({\n\ttranslate:{\n\t\thtml:function tpl(name, file, src) {\n\t\t\tvar opts = { id:name, src:src };\n\t\t\treturn 'module.exports=' + stencil.compile(opts, true) + ';';\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\troot: './components/', // file root path\n\tpath: '/module/', // url root path\n\t// ... other options\n}));\n```\n\n**Backbone**\n\nOne magic thing that I got for free, is that Backbone and Underscore are already CommonJS compatible, so passing them through the same middleware just worked. [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), and countless other Node.js modules also just work.\n\n**Adding it all together**\n\nWhile I chose to write my own templating and module components, many other libraries include the little hooks that make these synergies possible.

In 2000, a friend and I thought up a fantasy world we called Tsera, and I began writing a book about it.  It’s funny how much I wrote and then threw away.  In 2006 I had recently returned from Brazil and I decided to get going on that books again.  After reading the 200+ pages I had written prior, I was completely dissatisfied and started over.  Due to getting married, having kids, and trying to get an education, I now have a whole 10 pages worth in my book, <u>The Brothers of Linester</u>.</p>\n<p>Well, that seems to  state my life in a nutshell.  Life is good.</p>\n"},{"title":"I thought I new you(JavaScript);","id":"73","date":"2011-04-04T22:08:01.000Z","_content":"\nThis is the first of hopefully many posts aiming to demystify javascript.\n\nThe first thing to get over is the name. [JavaScript is not Java](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200909/java_is_not_javascript/). The name came from trying to ride on Java's hype. [JavaScript is to Java as Hamster is to Ham](http://adactio.com/journal/1595). Understand? Moving on...\n\nHopefully, most programmers now know that JavaScript is object-oriented. I'm afraid though that most believe object-oriented is synonymous with classical inheritance, which you will not find in JavaScript. JavaScript instead uses prototypal inheritance.\n\nClassical Inheritance in Java:\n\n```java\nclass Fruit {\n  private String name;\n  public Fruit(String n) { name = n; }\n  public toString() { return name; }\n}\n\nclass Banana extends Fruit {\n  public Banana() { super(\"banana\"); }\n}\n\n// (new Banana()) instanceof Banana and Fruit\n```\n\nWith classical inheritance, as in Java, you define classes. Classes are templates or blueprints for what an object of that type will be like. Objects, which are instances of a class, get all the methods and fields associated with the class and the classes it inherits.\n\nWhen you call a method, first the runtime looks in the class, then if it can't find the definition, it traverses up the class hierarchy until it finds the method definition.\n\nPrototypal Inheritance in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Fruit(name) { this.name = name; }\nFruit.prototype = { name:null, toString:function() { return this.name; } };\n\nfunction Banana() { Fruit.call(this, 'banana'); }\nBanana.prototype = new Fruit(null);\n\n// (new Banana()) instanceOf Banana and Fruit \n```\n\nAs you can see in JavaScript, with prototypal inheritance, there are no classes. The 'class' keyword is not used. Objects inherit from other objects. (The Banana prototype is an 'instance' of Fruit.) Constructors are just normal functions that you may call with the 'new' keyword.\n\nWhen you access any property, the runtime checks the object, then if it cannot find the property, it traverses up the prototype object hierarchy until it finds the property. If it doesn't find the property, it returns undefined.\n\nThe new keyword is a little deceptive, because it looks the same as Java. This is closer to what really happens:\n\n```javascript\n// var banana = new Banana(a, b);\nvar banana = {}; // new Object()\n// assume __proto__ is a hidden field, used internally for the prototype hierarchy\nbanana.__proto__ = Banana.prototype;\nvar temp = Banana.call(banana, a, b); // call the Banana function with 'this' set to the banana object\nbanana = (temp && typeof temp === 'object') ? temp : banana;\n\n// banana.name;\nvar temp = banana;\nwhile (!temp.hasOwnProperty('name') && temp.__proto__) { temp = temp.__proto__; }\nreturn temp.hasOwnProperty('name') ? temp.name : undefined;\n```\n\nPlease note that this code is an oversimplification, but hopefully helps you to understand what is happening behind the scenes. One of the interesting things you may have noticed from the above code is that when you call 'new Banana()', you might not get back what you expect. See one way you can implement the Factory pattern in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Fruit(name, color) {\n  if (typeof Fruit[name] === 'function')) return new Fruit[name]();\n  this.name = name;\n  this.color = color;\n  return this;\n}\nFruit.prototype = { name:null, color:null };\n\nFruit.Banana = function Banana() { return this; };\nFruit.Banana.prototype = new Fruit('Banana', 'yellow');\n\nFruit.Apple = function Apple() { return this; };\nFruit.Apple.prototype = new Fruit('Apple', 'red');\n\nvar banana = new Fruit('Banana'); // instanceOf Fruit and Banana\nvar apple = new Fruit('Apple'); // instanceOf Fruit and Apple\nvar kiwi = new Fruit('Kiwi'); // instanceOf Fruit\n```\n\nAs most of JavaScript's powerful dynamic features, it could easily be used for evil as well as for good.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Droid() { return new IPhone(); }\nvar phone = new Droid(); // this is not the droid you're looking for\n```\n\n[wtfjs.com](http://wtfjs.com/) is full of examples where JavaScript does weird things, but almost invariably because you tried to do something weird in the code. With a small amount of restraint on the developer's part, JavaScript can be powerful and need not be a mystery.\n","source":"_posts/i-thought-i-new-you-javascript.md","raw":"title: I thought I new you(JavaScript);\ntags:\n  - class\n  - inheritance\n  - JavaScript\n  - learn\n  - oop\n  - script\n  - understand\nid: 73\ncategories:\n  - JavaScript\ndate: 2011-04-04 16:08:01\n---\n\nThis is the first of hopefully many posts aiming to demystify javascript.\n\nThe first thing to get over is the name.

Check it out, or fork it at github: [http://github.com/thetalecrafter/require](http://github.com/thetalecrafter/require)\n\nLately I've been toying with dependency management in JavaScript. Most implementations of require (at least that I've seen) use polling, a function in the loaded script, synchronous XMLHttpRequest (dojo.require), or some combination of those.\n\nPolling is less than ideal, since more code runs than is necessary. It can slow down the responsiveness of the page if the interval is too short, and the user waits longer than necessary if the interval is too long.\n\nPutting a function in the loaded file means that everything you load has to understand the system. You cannot load arbitrary files. This makes it harder to do mash-ups involving other peoples' code.\n\nSynchronous requests lock up the browser. If the server is latent, the user may feel the browser has crashed, and if the server goes down, it can actually crash the browser. In addition, XMLHttpRequest responses are not cached like script tags, meaning that the dynamic packages may need to be reloaded with every page load.\n\nSo... when looking at writing my own require function I knew I wanted:\n\n*   Event-driven code. (No polling. No more code execution than necessary.)\n*   No requirements on the contents of required files.\n*   Asynchronous loads (No chance of freezing or crashing the browser.)\n*   Take advantage of the browser's cache.\n*   Nested requires.

Check it out, or fork it at github: <a href=\"http://github.com/thetalecrafter/require\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://github.com/thetalecrafter/require</a></p>\n<p>Lately I’ve been toying with dependency management in JavaScript. Most implementations of require (at least that I’ve seen) use polling, a function in the loaded script, synchronous XMLHttpRequest (dojo.require), or some combination of those.</p>\n<p>Polling is less than ideal, since more code runs than is necessary. It can slow down the responsiveness of the page if the interval is too short, and the user waits longer than necessary if the interval is too long.</p>\n<p>Putting a function in the loaded file means that everything you load has to understand the system. You cannot load arbitrary files. This makes it harder to do mash-ups involving other peoples’ code.</p>\n<p>Synchronous requests lock up the browser. If the server is latent, the user may feel the browser has crashed, and if the server goes down, it can actually crash the browser. In addition, XMLHttpRequest responses are not cached like script tags, meaning that the dynamic packages may need to be reloaded with every page load.</p>\n<p>So… when looking at writing my own require function I knew I wanted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Event-driven code. (No polling. No more code execution than necessary.)</li>\n<li>No requirements on the contents of required files.</li>\n<li>Asynchronous loads (No chance of freezing or crashing the browser.)</li>\n<li>Take advantage of the browser’s cache.</li>\n<li>Nested requires. (A file isn’t loaded until everything it requires is loaded.)</li>\n<li>Decent browser compatibility (IE6+, FF2+, Chrome, Safari 3+, Opera).</li>\n<li>No external library requirements.<br>One thing I ended up giving up to get the aforementioned wants: Loading scripts in parallel. Nested requires were unreliable since not all browsers guarantee execution order of dynamically inserted script tags, therefore too hard to determine the parent requirement. I’m looking at you Safari. Any pointers to improve that would be appreciated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My testing has been less than thorough, and there are many situations I didn’t try to handle. (Like checking to see if the script was already included statically.)</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here’s my code: (the most up-to-date is available on <a

A significant portion of the images came from \"private\" profiles. Learning this persuaded me to check on my \"private\" information and reinforced my hesitation to socialize online.\n\nA month ago, I was ungoogleable. I know, I tried every variation of my name and couldn't find anything, even after looking through 10 pages of results. Today, when I Google \"Andrew VanWagoner\", my LinkedIn profile is the first result. It has a link to this blog, and one to the site for my never-finished book. \"The TaleCrafter\" yields this blog and my book's site again. As I searched, I was glad to find I had kept my email, phone number, and address inconspicuous. Yet, if stalkers could access my college directory or Facebook profile, they would have all my contact information and more.\n\nWhat can average Joe do to keep himself from prying eyes?

useful without xlink: namespace)</li>\n<li>css transitions &amp; animations on svg styles (properties would also be nice)</li>\n<li>defs and use in html documents</li>\n<li>filters on html elements (Firefox is already working on this)</li>\n<li>unify styles like background and fill</li>\n<li>JavaScript DOM API identical<br>In short SVG and HTML would be one and the same. You would style both with the same css.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some nitpicks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m not sold on defining filters in markup, then using in style. It feels… odd. Why not define in style? (Oh no, that might be too much like IE’s filters! Gasp!)</li>\n<li>Animating is still a crapshoot. It feels like it should be in JavaScript, but declarative syntax is so much simpler, and easier to optimize for browsers. Some SMIL animations work in some browsers. CSS animations are still nacent but promising. (Even IE looks like it might implement it in ‘native HTML5’. Sorry, couldn’t help myself.) Still, JavaScript is the only reliable way right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me hear an Amen, or let me know what I’m missing.
