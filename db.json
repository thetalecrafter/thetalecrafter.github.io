When a new feature is available in a few browsers, I want to use it. Most of the time, these features are either experimental or not finished with the standardization process when they are generally available. So, they are prefixed by the vendor. This is how the process was designed, so that is what vendors do.\n\n**Why do we prefix?**\n\nPrefixing is a kind of disclaimer for the feature. \"Hey this is likely going to change, so don't rely on it.\" This seems in theory like a good way to go about it. If I am a browser maker, and I think of a cool new feature, like say, a gradient defined in css instead of an image, I really won't know how good my design is until lots of people have used it and given feedback. Of course, if I am conscientious of the community and betterment of the web for everybody, I share my idea with other browser vendors and get their take on it too. Often we have competing ideas of how to implement it, so we want a way to distinguish between them. This competition is wonderful, and will lead us to a better solution. So, I make my background-image:-andy-linear-gradient(...), and my competitor makes their background:-steve-gradient(linear, color-stop(), ...). Some people can try it out and it will work through the standards process and eventually everyone will have a background:linear-gradient(...) feature.\n\nIn theory it works out great, but what about in practice?\n\n**Here's what actually happens, from a dev's perspective.**\n\nMy favorite browser, Shiny, implements a cool new feature: -shiny-gradient(). I play with it and think it's really cool, but to be safe, I don't actually use it in any production site. A year later, the other browser I support, Ice Monster has long since added their own -ice-gradient(). Two years later, pretty much every browser has their own prefixed version, even the Laggard browser.\n\nNice. It only took two years for the feature to be generally available, so I start to use it, even though my code looks like this:\n\n```css\nbackground-image: -shiny-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(hsl(0, 80%, 70%)), to(#BADA55));\nbackground-image: -shiny-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:    -ice-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:    -lag-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:     -my-linear-gradient(top, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\nbackground-image:         linear-gradient(top bottom, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\n```\n\nI don't mind too much, because I use SASS or some other css pre-processor that actually takes care of all the prefixes and nuances. But this still bothers me in two important ways.\n\n1.  My stylesheets are getting much heavier than they used to be, which is a concern because I want people to be able to view my site quickly even on mobile devices. Most of the syntax is exactly the same, but I still have to write it over and over again for each vendor.\n2.  I have to opt in for each browser I want to get the feature. If a new browser becomes popular, it won't get the gradients unless I go back and add yet another version.\nI complain, but I keep doing it anyway. Two years later (Now **four years** since it was first introduced), The standard is still a draft, and because I want to support not just the bleeding edge browser, even when the standard finalizes I must leave all of the vendor prefixes indefinitely.\n\n**The problem gets more real with mobile.**\n\nManagement asks for a ShinyPhone version of our application. They don't care about Robot, even though it uses -shiny prefixes. I am given enough time to make the ShinyPhone version, but no time to even test in Robot. Eventually though, I manage to get it working because I own a Robot phone.\n\nA few months later, Catchup Phone 7, Ice Monster Mobile, and Concert Mini are showing up on more phones. They have their prefixed version of all the great Shiny features I used, but because I didn't know about them, the mobile application looks awful, and would take me several weeks to fix for each new phone. Management is not willing to spend that kind of time, so **even though they have all the features my site is broken for them**. Who will our customers blame? It works on ShinyPhone, so it must be that Ice Monster Mobile just isn't as good. **Ice Monster and other browsers get blamed for my site not working well there**.\n\n**The Solution?**\n\nIt is clear that if other browsers want to make themselves look good, they have to do more than just implement the feature. **If they just use -shiny prefixes**, that would make my application work far better, and therefore make their browser look good. But that completely undermines what we've learned in the browser wars, and goes against the reason for prefixing in the first place!\n\n**We don't really have a good solution yet.**\n\nHowever, I have an idea I think worth talking about. **What if the feature hadn't been prefixed at all?** I would have been less nervous to put it into production, because CSS simply doesn't apply rules that aren't implemented, and though it will likely change syntax, I can add new versions, and the one that is implemented will work. My stylesheet ends up more like this:\n\n```css\nbackground-image: gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(hsl(0, 80%, 70%)), to(#BADA55));\nbackground-image: linear-gradient(top bottom, hsl(0, 80%, 70%), #BADA55);\n```\n\nMy application just works for every browser that supports the feature with little thought or effort from my part, and if the spec doesn't change, which it actually doesn't change very often, I am already done more than four years before it is standardized.\n\n**Benefits of prefixing:**\n\n1.  **Sense** of security for browser vendors, so they can change the implementation and make it better.\n2.  Web developers **should** be aware that the feature isn't really ready yet.\n3.  **Credit** goes to the vendor who pioneered the feature.\n**Benefits of NOT prefixing:**\n\n1.  **Less effort** and maintenance for web developers trying to make their application (and browsers) look good. They don't need to spend a lot of time researching which browsers support which features.\n2.  **Lighter weight** stylesheets for everyone, especially mobile browsers.\n3.  Browser vendors can focus on the **feature**s, not on evangelizing their prefix.\n4.  **No -webkit- prefixes being supported by Mozilla**. Dang, I said it after trying so hard not to.\nHonestly I do see the value in prefixing experimental and non-standardized features, but vendors have to break them often, and the standard needs to move faster if developers are realistically going to experiment with experimental features, and wait for the standard for production use.\n\nPlease feel free to disagree in the comments, check out the discussion going on in the [w3c](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0313.html), or [read up](http://paulirish.com/2012/vendor-prefixes-are-not-developer-friendly/) on [other](http://blog.vandenoostende.com/2012/on-vendor-prefixes/) [opinions](http://www.sitepoint.com/w3c-css-webkit-prefix-crisis/).

When a new feature is available in a few browsers, I want to use it. Most of the time, these features are either experimental or not finished with the standardization process when they are generally available. So, they are prefixed by the vendor. This is how the process was designed, so that is what vendors do.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do we prefix?</strong></p>\n<p>Prefixing is a kind of disclaimer for the feature. “Hey this is likely going to change, so don’t rely on it.” This seems in theory like a good way to go about it. If I am a browser maker, and I think of a cool new feature, like say, a gradient defined in css instead of an image, I really won’t know how good my design is until lots of people have used it and given feedback. Of course, if I am conscientious of the community and betterment of the web for everybody, I share my idea with other browser vendors and get their take on it too. Often we have competing ideas of how to implement it, so we want a way to distinguish between them. This competition is wonderful, and will lead us to a better solution. So, I make my background-image:-andy-linear-gradient(…), and my competitor makes their background:-steve-gradient(linear, color-stop(), …). Some people can try it out and it will work through the standards process and eventually everyone will have a background:linear-gradient(…) feature.</p>\n<p>In theory it works out great, but what about in practice?</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what actually happens, from a dev’s perspective.</strong></p>\n<p>My favorite browser, Shiny, implements a cool new feature: -shiny-gradient(). I play with it and think it’s really cool, but to be safe, I don’t actually use it in any production site. A year later, the other browser I support, Ice Monster has long since added their own -ice-gradient(). Two years later, pretty much every browser has their own prefixed version, even the Laggard browser.</p>\n<p>Nice.

The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2\\. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.\n\nNot only did Amazon's library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/), but as fate would have it, that library didn't work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.\n\nThe script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn't depend on anything that isn't built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven't implemented yet.\n\n```php\n&lt;?php\n/**\n * AWS_SimpleDB_Client v0.1 by Andy VanWagoner, distributed under the ISC licence.\n * Provides simple access to Amazon's SimpleDB from PHP 5.\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2009, Andy VanWagoner\n *\n * Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\n * purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\n * copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n *\n * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\n * WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2\\. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.\n\nNot only did Amazon's library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/), but as fate would have it, that library didn't work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.\n\nThe script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn't depend on anything that isn't built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven't implemented yet.\n\n```php\n&lt;?php\n/**\n * AWS_SimpleDB_Client v0.1 by Andy VanWagoner, distributed under the ISC licence.\n * Provides simple access to Amazon's SimpleDB from PHP 5.\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2009, Andy VanWagoner\n *\n * Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\n * purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\n * copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n *\n * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\n * WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.</p>\n<p>Not only did Amazon’s library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Code</a>, but as fate would have it, that library didn’t work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.</p>\n<p>The script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn’t depend on anything that isn’t built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven’t implemented yet.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight php\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

Distributed Systems Design, I hit another stumbling block. The library that Amazon provides in PHP for accessing SimpleDB requires PHP 5.2. I should have known that I need to use the latest version.</p>\n<p>Not only did Amazon’s library not work for me, but it was huge and complicated. I found another library at: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-php/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Code</a>, but as fate would have it, that library didn’t work either. The code was pretty ugly imho, but at least it was straighforward enough for me to understand how accessing SimpleDB worked, which led me to make my own SimpleDB client.</p>\n<p>The script will work with any PHP 5, and doesn’t depend on anything that isn’t built in by default. I hope it is helpful to someone else. It would be really easy to add the SimpleDB requests I haven’t implemented yet.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight php\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

However, with Promises sometimes no error is ever thrown at all, your code just doesn't work as you expect it to.\n\nA small example to illustrate:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getResult() {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    someAsyncFunction(resolve) // this function may throw an error asynchronously\n  })\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, `reject` never gets called. You must explicitly handle the error condition, or you won't get so much as an error in the console. The error is thrown, but swallowed by the promise.\n\nSo why don't I just handle the error? The point is not that errors cannot be handled. They certainly can be. The problem is that it is easier to do the wrong thing with promises. By default errors are caught and ignored.\n\nFurthermore, async stack traces suck. This is a pain point for both promises and callbacks. Assuming an error occurs somewhere deep in asynchrony, the stack may only show you where the error was thrown, and have little or no context of where the function was called in the first place.\n\n**Both of these problems go away when using async function with await.**\n\nES7 (or ES 2016 if you prefer) proposes a new keywords `async` and `await`.

Especially if something else wanted to claim it first. You never know what is out there.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>No air. I desperately gulped at the void around my face, but I found nothing. Can’t think. Can’t breath. No air.</p>\n<p>My captor unsealed the mask, and a hint of breath filled my starving lungs. Then again, it was sucked out and I was left gasping in vain.</p>\n<p>The room tumbled about me, and the single light blinded me from everything else.</p>\n<p>My insides lurched and the mask filled with bile. Again the mask was removed, and I collapsed on the ground. The bindings on my wrist tore into my flesh through the sudden fall. I barely noticed. I wheezed in the breath of life.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to try this again,” rasped my reptilian captor. “Who else knows about this world?”</p>\n<p>I shook my head with closed eyes.</p>\n<p>The sudden force of a boot pressed every molecule of oxygen from my breast.</p>\n<p>“Final question,” it calmly continued. “After I have suffocated you in your own vomit, into which star shall I send your remains?”</p>\n<p>A weapons I couldn’t recognize rested against my head. In that moment I knew I could close my eyes forever. The searing pain in my chest and head would disappear. An accidental smile stole across my lips.</p>\n<p>“You worthless filth, you.” it sneered, feathers frilling out around its head.</p>\n<p>“I sent … a beacon,” I whispered, between shallow breaths.</p>\n<p>“What did you say?” roared the creature, lifting me up to its face.</p>\n<p>I tried to chuckle, but it turned into more of a cough. I took a solid breath and repeated, “I sent a beacon. It’s only a matter of time now.”</p>\n<p>In disgust, my captor tossed me aside. In a moment I was alone, and the room was silent. Yet I waited. Rather, I rested, and tried to recouperate from near suffocation and being kicked by a being five times my mass.</p>\n<p>The bite of the binding started to sting as my head cleared, so I got up and wandered to where my gear had been discarded. I took no time in locating my blade.</p>\n<p>Once my arms were free, I made my way out of the makeshift shack, and trekked back to the starship.

I even started a [repository on github](https://github.com/thetalecrafter/modules) for my implementation. As is apparent from [searching](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=commonjs+in+the+browser), the task is non-trivial, and there are lots of people trying to do the same thing, and every one of them has a different idea about how it should work.\n\n**But WHY would you want to use CommonJS (formerly known as ServerJS) modules in a client environment?**\n\nIdeally you can share modules between client and server, but that requires you to use a server environment like [node.js](nodejs.org), which might make management really nervous. Even without sharing the CommonJS module system helps us avoid some annoyances in JavaScript development.\n\n*   Each module has it's own scope. I don't have to manually wrap each file in a function to get a new variable scope. (Of course, to achieve this, the boilerplate is going to have to wrap each module's code in a function anyway.)\n*   Namespaces are only used in the require function, not everywhere in my code. Almost inevitably every web application I've worked in ends up using code like the following:\n```javascript\n    var whatIWanted = new FormerCompanyName.Common.CoolLibrary.ConstructorName( More.namespace.chains.than.you.can.follow );\n    // the rest of this file continues to use these ridiculously long namespaces\n```\n\nAlthough I'm sure many will disagree with me, I much prefer the CommonJS way:\n\n```javascript\n    var CoolModule = require('common/cool-library'),\n        thingINeed = require('more/namespace/chains/than/you/can/follow'),\n        whatIWanted = new CoolModule.ConstructorName(thingINeed);\n    // the rest of the file is void of long namespaces\n```\n\nAnd much more importantly, when I define a new module (or class as some insist on calling them):\n\n```javascript\n    FormerCompanyName.Common.CoolLibrary.ConstructorName = function() {/* ... */};\n    // versus\n    exports.ConstructorName = function() {/* ... */};\n    // or even\n    module.exports = function() {/* ... */} // this case isn't in the spec, but I really like it, so I made sure my library can handle it.\n```\n*   Because you can also use relative module identifiers (\"./sibling-module\", \"../uncle-module\"), when the company changes it's name, it can be as simple as renaming a folder to update all the top-level module ids.\n*   Additionally, modules can be included in the page in any order, and are only executed when first required, instead of all modules executing immediately upon inclusion, requiring the script order to be specific and fragile. If I add a new module using CommonJS, I can just append it to the end of the list, otherwise I have to make sure it is earlier in the page than whatever uses it, and after whatever it uses.\n**Okay, but how much work is it going to be?**\n\nLet's walk through first what I wanted my server-side code to look like, then what it has to do to make it work on the other side.\n\nAs most of my server-side experience thus far has been in php, that's the first language I've used in my implementation.\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Awesome Application</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"awesome-styles.css\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- blah blah blah -->\n    <?= Modules::script() /* include all necessary script tags */ ?>\n    <script>require('awesome').go()</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe Modules class will look for all js files in the folder you put it in, and any subfolders, and will id them by their path.\n\nYes, I am including every module, not actually checking dependencies.

What I have found most fun so far is the synergy I get between certain components.\n\n**Templates**\n\nFirst off, I admit I'm a reinvent-the-wheel kind of engineer. I readily find some minor fault in existing solutions and decide I have to write my own. [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) is really great, especially for someone coming from a PHP background, who doesn't think logic-less templates are better than sliced bread. However, I really needed templates that can run asynchronously, doing file or network io for includes and other such magic.\n\nSo, I made [Stencil](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/stencil/). I was able to make templates that compile without mucking up the line numbers, so debugging is very straight-forward. No exception rethrowing necessary. The very-important async use case was satisfied without making all templates forced to use the async pattern.\n\n```javascript\nsync_result = sync_tpl(data); // works if no async code in template\nasync_tpl(data, function(err, async_result) { }); // always works\n```\n\nWhere the whole becomes more than the sum of parts: A small snippet makes it so I can directly `require` my templates, and get back the function instead of the string:\n\n```javascript\nrequire.extensions['.html'] = function(module, filename) {\n\tvar fs = require('fs'), stencil = require('stencil-js'),\n\t\topts = { id:filename, src:fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8') };\n\tmodule._compile(\n\t\t'module.exports=' + stencil.compile(opts, true) + ';',\n\t\tfilename\n\t);\n};\n```\n\nNow the rest of my code that uses templates doesn't have to care that I use Stencil. You just `tpl = require('path/to/template.html')`. This is possible because Node.js has an extensible require, and Stencil allows you to compile to a JavaScript string instead of just to a function. If I were to go back and change the templating system to EJS, Jade, or Mustache, I would only need to update this one little snippet.\n\n**Client CommonJS**\n\nI liked Node.js's module system, and I didn't want to have to [replace it](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) or use a separate system on the front end.

Each component individually is really nothing spectacular, but when you put them all together you get a product that is cohesive from front to back, and really fun to work on.\n","source":"_posts/greater-than-the-sum-of-its-components.md","raw":"title: Greater than the sum of its components\ntags:\n  - AMD\n  - CommonJS\n  - JavaScript\n  - Node.js\n  - require\nid: 148\ncategories:\n  - JavaScript\ndate: 2013-02-19 17:36:43\n---\n\nLately I've been working on a cool project written exclusively in JavaScript, with a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) back end, and a [CommonJS](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/modules/) [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) front end. What I have found most fun so far is the synergy I get between certain components.\n\n**Templates**\n\nFirst off, I admit I'm a reinvent-the-wheel kind of engineer. I readily find some minor fault in existing solutions and decide I have to write my own. [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) is really great, especially for someone coming from a PHP background, who doesn't think logic-less templates are better than sliced bread. However, I really needed templates that can run asynchronously, doing file or network io for includes and other such magic.\n\nSo, I made [Stencil](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/stencil/). I was able to make templates that compile without mucking up the line numbers, so debugging is very straight-forward. No exception rethrowing necessary. The very-important async use case was satisfied without making all templates forced to use the async pattern.\n\n```javascript\nsync_result = sync_tpl(data); // works if no async code in template\nasync_tpl(data, function(err, async_result) { }); // always works\n```\n\nWhere the whole becomes more than the sum of parts: A small snippet makes it so I can directly `require` my templates, and get back the function instead of the string:\n\n```javascript\nrequire.extensions['.html'] = function(module, filename) {\n\tvar fs = require('fs'), stencil = require('stencil-js'),\n\t\topts = { id:filename, src:fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8') };\n\tmodule._compile(\n\t\t'module.exports=' + stencil.compile(opts, true) + ';',\n\t\tfilename\n\t);\n};\n```\n\nNow the rest of my code that uses templates doesn't have to care that I use Stencil. You just `tpl = require('path/to/template.html')`. This is possible because Node.js has an extensible require, and Stencil allows you to compile to a JavaScript string instead of just to a function. If I were to go back and change the templating system to EJS, Jade, or Mustache, I would only need to update this one little snippet.\n\n**Client CommonJS**\n\nI liked Node.js's module system, and I didn't want to have to [replace it](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) or use a separate system on the front end. Don't get me started on mess of [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd). So, I created my own [Modules library](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/modules/).

Extreme programming, iterative development, and release early release often provide the designers and developers with more and better feedback from customers.\n\nI recently helped develop a custom software package, and I learned very quickly into the project that knowing upfront what the product needed to do was near impossible. Incrementally adding functions as they we discovered they were needed turned out to be fairly quick and easy, since we kept the architecture simple adding only what we knew was necessary, and removing what we found to not work, or not be necessary.\n\nNot only are these approaches better for the end result, but they are certainly more motivating for the developers themselves. At each stage of the process there is a prototype that compiles and runs, whether or not all the functionality is there. This helps avoid propagating early mistakes. Also, they can focus on one aspect of the product at a time, and receive verification from testing, and validation from the customer.

[JavaScript is not Java](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200909/java_is_not_javascript/). The name came from trying to ride on Java's hype. [JavaScript is to Java as Hamster is to Ham](http://adactio.com/journal/1595). Understand? Moving on...\n\nHopefully, most programmers now know that JavaScript is object-oriented. I'm afraid though that most believe object-oriented is synonymous with classical inheritance, which you will not find in JavaScript. JavaScript instead uses prototypal inheritance.\n\nClassical Inheritance in Java:\n\n```java\nclass Fruit {\n  private String name;\n  public Fruit(String n) { name = n; }\n  public toString() { return name; }\n}\n\nclass Banana extends Fruit {\n  public Banana() { super(\"banana\"); }\n}\n\n// (new Banana()) instanceof Banana and Fruit\n```\n\nWith classical inheritance, as in Java, you define classes. Classes are templates or blueprints for what an object of that type will be like. Objects, which are instances of a class, get all the methods and fields associated with the class and the classes it inherits.\n\nWhen you call a method, first the runtime looks in the class, then if it can't find the definition, it traverses up the class hierarchy until it finds the method definition.\n\nPrototypal Inheritance in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Fruit(name) { this.name = name; }\nFruit.prototype = { name:null, toString:function() { return this.name; } };\n\nfunction Banana() { Fruit.call(this, 'banana'); }\nBanana.prototype = new Fruit(null);\n\n// (new Banana()) instanceOf Banana and Fruit \n```\n\nAs you can see in JavaScript, with prototypal inheritance, there are no classes. The 'class' keyword is not used. Objects inherit from other objects. (The Banana prototype is an 'instance' of Fruit.) Constructors are just normal functions that you may call with the 'new' keyword.\n\nWhen you access any property, the runtime checks the object, then if it cannot find the property, it traverses up the prototype object hierarchy until it finds the property. If it doesn't find the property, it returns undefined.\n\nThe new keyword is a little deceptive, because it looks the same as Java. This is closer to what really happens:\n\n```javascript\n// var banana = new Banana(a, b);\nvar banana = {}; // new Object()\n// assume __proto__ is a hidden field, used internally for the prototype hierarchy\nbanana.__proto__ = Banana.prototype;\nvar temp = Banana.call(banana, a, b); // call the Banana function with 'this' set to the banana object\nbanana = (temp && typeof temp === 'object') ? temp : banana;\n\n// banana.name;\nvar temp = banana;\nwhile (!temp.hasOwnProperty('name') && temp.__proto__) { temp = temp.__proto__; }\nreturn temp.hasOwnProperty('name') ? temp.name : undefined;\n```\n\nPlease note that this code is an oversimplification, but hopefully helps you to understand what is happening behind the scenes. One of the interesting things you may have noticed from the above code is that when you call 'new Banana()', you might not get back what you expect. See one way you can implement the Factory pattern in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Fruit(name, color) {\n  if (typeof Fruit[name] === 'function')) return new Fruit[name]();\n  this.name = name;\n  this.color = color;\n  return this;\n}\nFruit.prototype = { name:null, color:null };\n\nFruit.Banana = function Banana() { return this; };\nFruit.Banana.prototype = new Fruit('Banana', 'yellow');\n\nFruit.Apple = function Apple() { return this; };\nFruit.Apple.prototype = new Fruit('Apple', 'red');\n\nvar banana = new Fruit('Banana'); // instanceOf Fruit and Banana\nvar apple = new Fruit('Apple'); // instanceOf Fruit and Apple\nvar kiwi = new Fruit('Kiwi'); // instanceOf Fruit\n```\n\nAs most of JavaScript's powerful dynamic features, it could easily be used for evil as well as for good.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Droid() { return new IPhone(); }\nvar phone = new Droid(); // this is not the droid you're looking for\n```\n\n[wtfjs.com](http://wtfjs.com/) is full of examples where JavaScript does weird things, but almost invariably because you tried to do something weird in the code. With a small amount of restraint on the developer's part, JavaScript can be powerful and need not be a mystery.\n","source":"_posts/i-thought-i-new-you-javascript.md","raw":"title: I thought I new you(JavaScript);\ntags:\n  - class\n  - inheritance\n  - JavaScript\n  - learn\n  - oop\n  - script\n  - understand\nid: 73\ncategories:\n  - JavaScript\ndate: 2011-04-04 16:08:01\n---\n\nThis is the first of hopefully many posts aiming to demystify javascript.\n\nThe first thing to get over is the name.

The name came from trying to ride on Java’s hype. <a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/1595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript is to Java as Hamster is to Ham</a>. Understand? Moving on…</p>\n<p>Hopefully, most programmers now know that JavaScript is object-oriented. I’m afraid though that most believe object-oriented is synonymous with classical inheritance, which you will not find in JavaScript. JavaScript instead uses prototypal inheritance.</p>\n<p>Classical Inheritance in Java:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight java\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">Fruit</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">private</span> String name;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"title\">Fruit</span><span class=\"params\">(String n)</span> </span>&#123; name = n; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"title\">toString</span><span class=\"params\">()</span> </span>&#123; <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> name; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"class\"><span class=\"keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"title\">Banana</span> <span class=\"keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"title\">Fruit</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"title\">Banana</span><span class=\"params\">()</span> </span>&#123; <span class=\"keyword\">super</span>(<span class=\"string\">\"banana\"</span>); &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// (new Banana()) instanceof Banana and Fruit</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>With classical inheritance, as in Java, you define classes. Classes are templates or blueprints for what an object of that type will be like. Objects, which are instances of a class, get all the methods and fields associated with the class and the classes it inherits.</p>\n<p>When you call a method, first the runtime looks in the class, then if it can’t find the definition, it traverses up the class hierarchy until it finds the method definition.</p>\n<p>Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">Fruit</span>(<span class=\"params\">name</span>) </span>&#123; <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.name = name; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">Fruit.prototype = &#123; <span class=\"attr\">name</span>:<span class=\"literal\">null</span>, <span class=\"attr\">toString</span>:<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123; <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.name; &#125; &#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">Banana</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123; Fruit.call(<span class=\"keyword\">this</span>, <span class=\"string\">'banana'</span>); &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">Banana.prototype = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> Fruit(<span class=\"literal\">null</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// (new Banana()) instanceOf Banana and Fruit</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>As you can see in JavaScript, with prototypal inheritance, there are no classes. The ‘class’ keyword is not used. Objects inherit from other objects. (The Banana prototype is an ‘instance’ of Fruit.) Constructors are just normal functions that you may call with the ‘new’ keyword.</p>\n<p>When you access any property, the runtime checks the object, then if it cannot find the property, it traverses up the prototype object hierarchy until it finds the property. If it doesn’t find the property, it returns undefined.</p>\n<p>The new keyword is a little deceptive, because it looks the same as Java.

Check it out, or fork it at github: [http://github.com/thetalecrafter/require](http://github.com/thetalecrafter/require)\n\nLately I've been toying with dependency management in JavaScript. Most implementations of require (at least that I've seen) use polling, a function in the loaded script, synchronous XMLHttpRequest (dojo.require), or some combination of those.\n\nPolling is less than ideal, since more code runs than is necessary. It can slow down the responsiveness of the page if the interval is too short, and the user waits longer than necessary if the interval is too long.\n\nPutting a function in the loaded file means that everything you load has to understand the system. You cannot load arbitrary files. This makes it harder to do mash-ups involving other peoples' code.\n\nSynchronous requests lock up the browser. If the server is latent, the user may feel the browser has crashed, and if the server goes down, it can actually crash the browser. In addition, XMLHttpRequest responses are not cached like script tags, meaning that the dynamic packages may need to be reloaded with every page load.\n\nSo... when looking at writing my own require function I knew I wanted:\n\n*   Event-driven code. (No polling. No more code execution than necessary.)\n*   No requirements on the contents of required files.\n*   Asynchronous loads (No chance of freezing or crashing the browser.)\n*   Take advantage of the browser's cache.\n*   Nested requires.

Nested requires were unreliable since not all browsers guarantee execution order of dynamically inserted script tags, therefore too hard to determine the parent requirement.

The ordinances are <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/3/5#5\" title=\"John 3 v 5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">necessary</a>, but <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/2/8#8\" title=\"Second Nephi 2 v 8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not sufficient</a> for salvation.  I know that Christ is our Savior.  It is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">only</span> through His <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/eph/2/5-9#5\" title=\"Ephesians 2 vv 5-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grace</a> - His Atonement - that we can overcome and be saved from our sins, after we have done <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/25/23#23\" title=\"Second Nephi 25 v 23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all we can</a>.</p>\n<p>Membership in the only true church gives us access to the priesthood authority necessary for the ordinances Christ has established.  Any authority outside of the Church of Jesus Christ is <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_chr/26/18#18\" title=\"Second Chronicles 26 v 18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incomplete</a>.  However, church membership in no way guarantees salvation.  We must make and <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/52/15-16#15\" title=\"Doctrine and Covenants 52 vv 15-16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>keep</em></a> the covenants with God to accept the Atonement and be saved.</p>\n<p>This is the key, where Mormonism and mainstream Christianity agree: Christ is Savior and Redeemer.  There is no other <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/14/6#6\" title=\"John 14 v 6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">way</a> or <a href=\"http://scriptures.lds.org/en/mosiah/3/17#17\" title=\"Mosiah 3 v 17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">name</a> given under heaven whereby men may be saved.</p>\n<p>I know that God lives, and that His Son, Jesus Christ is our Savior.  I know Christ has, and will continue to call prophets to lead His Church, to teach His people, and to perform ordinances by His authority.  All that I or anyone knows of God and Heaven has come by revelation through prophets.  Without them, we would have no Bible, no Book of Mormon, and no understanding of our eternal potential and worth to our Father.   I know Our Father sent His Son to live, to die, and to live again for us.   I bare this, my witness, in the name of Jesus Christ.   Amen.</p>\n<p>Further Readings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basic-beliefs/the-restoration-of-truth/\" title=\"Mormon.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Restoration of Truth</em> - Mormon.org</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=a05379356427b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1\" title=\"Ensign, Jan 1988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Warring against the Saints of God</em> - Stephen E.

Some have suggested we are already in 3.0, with HTML5 and SVG well supported in the latest version of every major browser. What I’d like to talk about, is what I wish would come next.</p>\n<p>As many who are immersed in front-end web development have noticed, HTML and SVG have different DOMs, different styles, and competing animation tools. They have been getting better, with HTML5’s inline SVG support, and browsers beginning to bring each markup’s features to the other, but the inconsistencies are still painful, and and they make implementation both for web and browser developers sub-optimal.</p>\n<p>What I would love to see is something akin to the following document:<br><figure class=\"highlight html\"><table><tr><td

So for two years now, I have drug along “<a href=\"mailto:thetalecrafter@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thetalecrafter@gmail.com</a>“ as a backup address. I don’t craft tales, and I don’t like Google.</p>\n<p>Finally a straw broke the camel’s back, and I decided it was time to really ditch thetalecrafter. The handle, the email address, and the website (this one). On a whim I was looking at domain names, and found that <code>vanwago.net</code> was available. That would be a solid alias for <code>vanwagoner.family</code>, using a TLD that even AOL recognizes. Once I had the domain, I figured it didn’t make a terrible handle either.</p>\n<p>Hi, I’m “vanwagonet”. I’m not on Facebook or Twitter these days, but I am on <a href=\"https://github.com/vanwagonet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewvanwagoner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn</a>, and every few years I write things down on <a href=\"https://andy.vanwago.net\">this site</a>. I may <a href=\"/2015/07/25/jumping-the-fold/\">spin some tales</a> <a href=\"/2015/06/23/breathless-in-a-new-world/\">in the future</a>, but even if I don’t, I’ll still be Andy VanWagoner.</p>\n<script type=\"module\">alert('hi!')</script>\n"},{"title":"Why We Are Hooked","id":"21","date":"2008-04-01T15:56:08.000Z","_content":"\nAs people have slowly discovered the Internet, many have found they are spending more time online than they have available.
