To understand my writing, it is important to know my background. [I'm a Mormon](http://mormon.org/me/9ZNG), a member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://www.lds.org "The Official Church Website"). Though I consider myself very knowledgeable in the doctrines of the Church, my beliefs and comments in no way represent the official stance of the Church. With that disclaimer, I believe I haven't fallen far from the tree.

I invite people to comment on my posts, with the understanding that disrespectful comments will be quickly removed. Disagree if you will, but please be respectful.

All of the posts I write relating to my faith, can be found in the [faith category](https://thetalecrafter.com/categories/faith/ "Posts on Faith").

I would also encourage those with serious issues with Church history or doctrine to look up their issue at [fairlds.org](http://www.fairlds.org/ "LDS FAIR Apologetics"). People who write there have studied a lot more than I have, and can more accurately address concerns.
