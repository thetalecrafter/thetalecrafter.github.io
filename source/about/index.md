My name is Andrew VanWagoner, and I am originally from Taylorsville, Utah, USA. I am married, and we have four kids.

This blog started in 2008 as a college assignment for an [Ethics and Computers in Society](/categories/ethics-and-computers-in-society/) class. Of the posts you will find here, a few of them will deal with writing fiction, a few will be discussions about our society as once I perceived it, or about various neat tidbits I pick up here and there, but most of them will probably be about software.

Don't be too judgmental of things I wrote years ago. I reserve the right to change my mind and grow into new understanding, but I think it's still valuable to preserve past snapshots of my thinking. I'm likely wrong as often as right, and I'm surprised if you are reading this anyway.

Just a note, my family descended from [John Halmagh Van Wagoner](http://www.jackandsharensimmons.com/vans/7.htm), whose family came from Wageningen in the central Netherlands. So, to you other Van Wagoners, VanWagoners, and Van Wagenens out there, if that name rings a bell, we're probably related.
