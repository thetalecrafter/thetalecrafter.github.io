Nearly all that we think - and everything we say - are in words. Our ability to transmit information relies on language. Words invoke emotions. Words record dreams. Doing well in school is often a matter of learning the right words. They give us the ability to grasp new concepts, and without them, we have no expression for our understanding. Perhaps that's why God was called the Word and Christ Alpha and Omega.
