Today is Online Free Expression Day. [Reporters Without Borders (RSF)](http://www.rsf.org/ "RSF") is promoting public "virtual" protests against governments that censor Internet content, calling them [Internet enemies](http://us.oneworld.net/external/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rsf.org%2Farticle.php3%3Fid_article%3D26017 "Internet enemies"). My question is, how much should the government intervene? Harassment, indecent exposure, and sedition are all punishable off of the web, so should the government block this content on the web? The problem is that there is no clear line as to where content becomes unreasonably objectionable. I assert that the government should have a say about what information stumbles into the hands of the people they are sworn to protect, but the line should be determined by the voters. The people should know what is being blocked.
