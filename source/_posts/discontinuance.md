I hope I am not disappointing too many people, but I don't feel strongly enough about this blog and I don't have enough I want to say to blog on a regular basis.

If you are interested in reading things my wife and I write, we have a blog at [vanwagoner.wordpress.com](http://vanwagoner.wordpress.com).Â  It will likely be mostly her postings, but when I do write, it will go there first.
