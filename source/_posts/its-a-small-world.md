"It's a small world after all." The Sherman Brothers presented that novel idea at the 1964 World's Fair. That was before Google. Now the world is at the average Joe's fingertips. Yesterday's obstacles of distance, language, and culture are dissolving as millions connect instantly on the Internet. But there is a catch. Internet communication has become so easy, that though Joe chats with dozens online, he has never had more than five word conversations with his roommate. Even if he has, he can't remember the guy's name.
