Whether it's playing a video game, or shopping the latest styles, "I can stop whenever I want" is insufficient. Repeatedly saying: "Five more minutes", "one last game", or "just one more..." is an early red flag of addiction. Understand that entertainment is useful, even requisite for sanity at times, but not a replacement for life. Few would list a new video game record as a priority, so don't give it more time than your work, education, or family. All play and no work make Joe own you at Halo, but lose his part-time job.
