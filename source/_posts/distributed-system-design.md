This is my last semester at BYU, and I am taking Distributes System Design. As I go through the preocess of creating (with my classmates) a distributed web application, I will be logging my progress and experiences here.

P.S. - Happy Civil Rights Day! I'm using this holiday to catch up on my homework.
