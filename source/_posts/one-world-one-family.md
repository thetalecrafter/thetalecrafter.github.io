We are all related somehow. The idea certainly doesn't appeal to everybody; I know that I know people I'd never admit kinship with no matter how closely our genes match. Yet we are all connected. If you go far enough up the family tree we all come from the same Adam and Eve, and it's surprising how many of us are related through much more recent figures in history, such as [Charlemagne](http://www.familyorigins.com/users/b/l/o/David-A-Blocher-WA/FAMO2-0001/index.htm). We, the descendants of so many great people, have the task of finding how we are connected and of learning about those who came before. It has never been easier than now, in our time of Internet communication.
