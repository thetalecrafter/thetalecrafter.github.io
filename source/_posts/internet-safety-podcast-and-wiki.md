A few months ago, my wife and I began listening to the [Internet Safety Podcast](http://internetsafetypodcast.com/ "Internet Safety Podcast") put on by Charles Knutson and Joe Brockbank. What we found were simple ideas to protect our family from the trash on the Internet, without throwing the baby out with the bath water. I recommend to any parents out there to listen to podcast. It's interesting and fun, but still educates on how we can keep up with our tech-savvy kids.

Also on their web site is the [Internet Safety Wiki](http://wiki.internetsafetypodcast.com/ "Internet Safety Wiki"). This is a fledgling site dedicated to same principles as the Internet Safety Podcast. What they need, though, are more contributers. To the tech-savvy out there, this is a chance to make a positive difference helping parents learn about the technologies of today. Contribute your knowledge and skills to the Internet Safety Wiki.
