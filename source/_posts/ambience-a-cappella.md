In high school some friends and I made an a cappella group called Ambience. My brother Jacob was our 1st tenor, I sang 2nd tenor, Jacob Morris sang baritone, and Trevor Watts sang bass. We traded parts often, too. We weren't that good, 	but we did have a lot of fun. Below are a few of our songs. (The only ones I dare 	let the public hear.)
