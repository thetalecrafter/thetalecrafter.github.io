As people have slowly discovered the Internet, many have found they are spending more time online than they have available. Along with the overwhelming wealth of knowledge on the Internet, is the ability to connect with other people. This connection, in my opinion, is what hooks us. If you look in gaming, it is the MMORPGs, and other games that allow interaction with other players that keep loyal players for extended periods of time. If you see other successful Internet applications like email, IM, social networks, and blogs, these all appeal to our social nature. The paradox is that often when we are spending too much time being social online, we neglect our face-to-face relationships.
